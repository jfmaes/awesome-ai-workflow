# OPS.md

> Operational guide. Updated during build loops and interactive sessions.
> KEEP UNDER 60 LINES. Status/progress belong in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.
> Loaded every iteration — bloat here pollutes every future context window.
> NOTE: Named OPS.md (not AGENTS.md) to avoid collision with Codex project instructions.

- Tests: `[command]`
- Typecheck: `[command]`
- Lint: `[command]`
