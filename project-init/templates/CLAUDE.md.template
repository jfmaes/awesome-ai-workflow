## Project

- **Name:** [PROJECT_NAME]
- **Description:** [1-2 sentences]
- **Stack:** [language, framework, key deps]

## Commands

```bash
# Build
[command]

# Run
[command]

# Test (all)
[command]

# Test (specific)
[command — e.g., pytest path/to/test.py]

# Lint
[command]

# Type check (if applicable)
[command]
```

## Architecture

- **Source code:** [path]
- **Tests:** [path]
- **Shared utilities:** [path — treat as project stdlib]
- **Config:** [key config files]

## Code Style

- [Convention 1]
- [Convention 2]
- [Convention 3]
- File naming: [convention]
- Import order: [convention]

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER do these)

- [AI-specific anti-pattern for this codebase]
- Never leave placeholder/stub implementations — implement completely or don't start

## Git

- Branch naming: [convention]
- Commit messages: [convention]
- Always `git add -A && git commit` after passing tests

## Complexity Tiers

Assess every task before starting. State the tier. User can override.

- **T0 (Just do it):** Single file, clear intent, low risk → execute directly
- **T1 (Think aloud):** 1-3 files, medium scope → state approach, then execute
- **T2 (Spec & plan):** Multi-file, design decisions → draft spec → approval → plan → build
- **T3 (Full spec + plan):** Architecture, multi-session → full spec.md + plan.md + approval gates

Signals: files touched, reversibility, domain risk, ambiguity, duration, audience.
Override phrases: "just do it" → T0, "let's plan" → T2+, "Ralph it" → T3 with loop.
