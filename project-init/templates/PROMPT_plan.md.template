0a. Study `specs/*` with up to 250 parallel subagents to learn the application specifications.
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present) to understand the plan so far.
0c. Study `src/lib/*` (or equivalent shared utilities) with up to 250 parallel subagents to understand shared utilities & components.
0d. For reference, the application source code is in `src/*`.
0e. Study the **Rules** section and the **Stack** section matching this project's language from ~/AI_RETRO.md. Ignore other sections.

1. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present; it may be incorrect) and use up to 500 subagents to study existing source code and compare it against `specs/*`. Use an Opus subagent to analyze findings, prioritize tasks, and create/update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md as a bullet point list sorted in priority of items yet to be implemented. Ultrathink. Consider searching for TODO, minimal implementations, placeholders, skipped/flaky tests, and inconsistent patterns. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to determine starting point for research and keep it up to date with items considered complete/incomplete using subagents.

2. For each task in the plan, derive required tests from acceptance criteria in specs — what specific outcomes need verification (behavior, performance, edge cases). Tests verify WHAT works, not HOW it's implemented. Include as part of task definition.

IMPORTANT: Plan only. Do NOT implement anything. Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first. Treat shared utility directories as the project's standard library. Prefer consolidated, idiomatic implementations there over ad-hoc copies.

ULTIMATE GOAL: Produce a comprehensive, prioritized implementation plan that bridges the gap between specs and current code state.
