# AI_RETRO.md — Cross-Project Learnings

> Location: ~/AI_RETRO.md (outside any repo — shared across all projects)
> Updated automatically by PROMPT_reflect.md and PROMPT_build.md
>
> SIZE RULES (enforced during reflection):
>   - Rules:          max 20 lines (universal, distilled, proven patterns)
>   - Each stack:     max 10 lines (only loaded when relevant)
>   - Recent:         max 20 entries (rolling buffer — promote or drop when full)
>   - If a section exceeds its cap, consolidate: merge similar items,
>     promote proven patterns to Rules, archive the rest.
>
> LOADING RULES (for prompts):
>   - Build/plan prompts load ONLY: Rules + the matching Stack section
>   - Reflect prompt loads the full file to perform maintenance
>   - Never load the Archive file into build/plan context

## Rules

[Universal patterns that apply to ALL projects — earned through repeated experience]
[Examples: "Always search before assuming something isn't implemented"]
[Keep entries to one line each. If you need more, it's not distilled enough.]

## Stack: Python

[Learnings specific to Python projects]

## Stack: C# / .NET

[Learnings specific to C# projects]

## Stack: Web / Frontend

[Learnings specific to web projects]

## Stack: Infrastructure / Docker

[Learnings specific to infra work]

## Recent

[New learnings land here. Rolling buffer of max 20 entries.]
[Format: YYYY-MM-DD | project | learning]
[During reflection: if >20 entries, promote proven patterns to Rules/Stack or drop]
